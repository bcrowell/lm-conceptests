\begin{qu}[Superposing perpendicular fields]\num
Suppose we have a uniform field in the $x$ direction, represented as field lines spaced 1 cm
apart. Another uniform field, of the same strength, points in the $y$ direction.
Suppose that these two fields are now superposed. In the superposition, about how far
apart are the lines, in cm?
