\begin{qu}[Parallel AC voltages]\num
A sinusoidal AC voltage is being used to drive the circuit,
and the oscilloscope measures the voltages, which we represent as complex numbers.
The black dot shows the grounded side of the scope's input.
The measurement shows that $\mytilde{V}_R$ is real and negative.

\noindent $\mytilde{V}_C$ is therefore

A. real and positive.

B. positive imaginary.

C. real and negative.

D. negative imaginary
