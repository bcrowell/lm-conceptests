\begin{qu}[Defroster]\num
The rear window in many cars has an electrical defroster consisting
of a grid of thin silver-ceramic lines that are essentially painted onto the glass.
A fixed voltage difference of 12 V from the car's battery is applied across the
defroster, which acts as a resistor with a resistance of on the order of one ohm.

Suppose that as a certain car gets older, physical changes in the grid cause its
resistance to \emph{decrease}. The amount of heat generated

A. goes down.

B. stays the same.

C. goes up.

D. There is no way to tell without more data.
