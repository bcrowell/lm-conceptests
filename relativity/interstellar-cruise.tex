\begin{qu}\num
Eddie has always been his grandmother's favorite grandchild, so he
gets invited with her on an interstellar cruise. After the ship has accelerated
to 30\%
of the speed of light, Eddie unbuckles his seatbelt, hops out of his acceleration
couch, and extracts a folding meter-stick from his suitcase. Using the meter-stick,
he measures the length of the cabin from front to back.

\vspace{20mm}

A. The cabin measures more meters than before the ship accelerated.

B. The cabin measures fewer meters than before.

C. The cabin measures the same.

D. The effect is too small to be observable, because the ship's speed is still small compared
to the speed of light.
