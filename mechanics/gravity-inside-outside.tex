\begin{qu}\num
 A wedge has been cut out of the earth to let us see inside it.
Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 all lie along the same radial line. Point 1 is at the
earth's center, 3 at its surface, and 2 in the interior of the earth at the
midpoint between 1 and 3.

Rank the points by the strength of their gravitational fields, from weakest
to strongest.
