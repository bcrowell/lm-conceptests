\wrap{5}{50mm}{mechanics/figs/paddle-ball}
\num{} You hit the ball with the paddle,
and when the rubber band becomes taut, it makes the ball come back to you.
Consider these forces:

$F_p$, a force of the paddle on the ball

$F_r$, a force of the rubber band on the ball

\noindent A. Both act at point 1 in the motion, and both also at 2.

\noindent B. $F_p$ acts at 1, and $F_r$ at 2.

\noindent C. $F_p$ acts at 1, and both act at 2.

\noindent D. Neither force acts at 1 or 2.
