\begin{qu}[Recoil from a jumping flea, part 2]\num
 We adopt the frame
of reference in which Joe is initially at rest.
After the flea jumps, describe the kinetic
energy of the recoiling planet earth.

\includegraphics{mechanics/figs/flea}

A. The earth's KE is zero.

B. The earth gains much more KE than the flea.

C. The earth's larger mass and smaller speed give it the same KE as the flea.

D. The earth gains much less KE than the flea.

E. Energy is conserved, so the earth loses an amount of KE the same as what the flea gains.
