\begin{qu}\num
 Some buses in Switzerland contain massive flywheels that store
kinetic energy when the bus goes downhill, then release it when it needs to
go up again. If the velocity of the spinning wheel could be doubled, its
mass could be cut by a factor of

A. $\sqrt{2}$.

B. 2.

C. 4.

D. It would still have to have the same mass.
